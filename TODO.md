
## Prepare Documentation to Share

- write up methodology doc, this can serve as a reference for communication
    + can use metric defs, etc. from existing state-supplied data documentation
    + include specifics that relate to the nat/reg dashboard
    + also reference individual state methods docs
    
- weighted averages for churn & part. rate? (probably we do want this)

## Future Iterations

- probably peg national/regional to counts of hunters/anglers? This is complicated by a couple of factors:
    + only looking at 18-64 year-olds
    + not obvious how nonresidents should be counted
    + no clear way to include mid-year results

## Data Status Notes: 14 states (sep 2019)
