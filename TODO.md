- get setup to share with Ben
    + calc participation rate
    + get averages (nat/reg)
    + compare to previous iteration (try to be consistent)

#### Later

- come up with a method for imputing missing values for trends
- Document the known issues with NE/MA and follow-up
    + hopefully an easy fix, analysts from both states used R, so that is a big plus

### Mid-Year

Need to get more data for this, we'll see

## Validation

- sniff test to make sure things don't look off
- are the measures complete?
- do segments all sum to totals?

## Averages with missing values

Presenting avgs is a problem with all the missing data. My thinking is that for any particular measure, we can assume that the missing values moved in the same way as the values that we have. For example, if we don't have participation rate for TN in 2008, we assume the TN impact on the average is the same as TN's impact in 2009 (i.e., the states without missing values are essentially estimating a % change measure)


## State Notes (Temporary)

### MA

- no all_sports
- no mid-year
- any data issues?

### NE

- data are incomplete
- churn doesn't follow year conventions (missing for 2018), probably means it needs to be set forward one year
- all_sports is missing certain data (at least participants)
- any other issues?

### FL

- will take a look

### TN

- only all sports

### IA

- hunting data has some issues (still awaiting response)
- no fishing nonresidents in 2008 (basically IA doesn't seem to have much of any nonres fishing licenses)
